# Questions to the client:
#   
# CHK_ACCT (Checking accounts)
#   The first category means that the checking accounts are in negative? Right so there is no limit at zero?
# 
# HISTORY (Credit history)
#   Is it really the case that the credit applications with a bad history are more graded as positive?
#     
# SAV_ACCT (Saving accounts)
#  Why if the client do not have a saving accounts at the bank, then the application is better rated? 
#    What is the different then between a small saving accounts and none?
#    
# GUARANTOR
#  Category 3? Is it a mistake?
#    
# EDUCATION
#  -1, again a mistake?
#    
# PRESENT_RESID
#  The categories should be between 0 and 3 but are between 1 and 4? What is the interpretation?
#    
# ANSWERS:
#    
# AGE:
#    One outlier to recode - 75 years old instead of 125 years old
