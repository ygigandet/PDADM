# Introduction

Our work for the course "Project in Data Analytics for Decision Making" is to predict the credit risk linked to customers for our client, a bank. 

To do so, we used the CRISP-DM method (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining):

- **Business understanding**: Credit risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from the failure by a borrower to repay the principal and interest owed to the lender. By performing a credit risk analysis, the lender determines the borrower's ability to meet debt obligations in order to cushion itself from losses. It is therefore important to efficiently classify the risks of the credit applications.

- **Data understanding and preparation**: We work on the `german` data set. 

- **Modelling**: We fitted several models to assess which one was the best.

- **Evaluation**: 

- **Deployment**:
